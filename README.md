This code creates a WebSocket server and communicates with clients (users). Let's explain how functions and events work step by step:

WebSocket and Server Creation:

First, import WebSocketServer and WebSocket classes along with the randomUUID function from the ws library.
WebSocketServer is used to create a WebSocket server, which starts listening on port 8080. It's assigned to the server variable.
A map called clients is created to store client information (WebSocket connection and username) paired with a unique identifier (UUID) for each client.
Connection Events:
The event server.on("connection", function connection(ws) { ... }) is triggered when a client connects. It creates a WebSocket connection for each connection.
A unique identifier (clientId) is generated for each connection, and this client information is added to the clients map.
When a connection is closed (ws.on("close", () => { ... })), the corresponding client information is removed from the clients map, and the user list is updated.
When an error occurs (ws.on("error", (error) => { ... })), the error is logged to the console.
Message Reception and Processing:
When a message is received from a client (ws.on("message", function incoming(message) { ... })), it's processed.
The incoming message is parsed as a JSON object (JSON.parse(message)).
Depending on the message type (type), different actions are taken:
"setUsername": The username is set, and the user list is updated.
"message": The received message is sent to all connected clients.
"keystroke": The keystrokes received are forwarded to the admin user.
Message Sending:
Messages are sent to all connected clients (handleIncomingMessage and handleKeystroke functions).
The user list is sent to all connected clients (sendUserList function).
Updating the User List:
The sendUserList function retrieves all connected users and sends them in a JSON message to all connected clients.
This function is called at regular intervals using setInterval to ensure the user list is regularly updated.
Server Startup:
Finally, the port on which the server is running is logged to the console.
This HTML file creates a user interface for the client side of a chat application. Let's explain its functionality and features:

General Styles:

The body element ensures the page is displayed centered and vertically aligned.
#chatContainer horizontally centers its contained elements and provides flexible width for content.
Online Users Section:
#onlineUsers displays online users.
Users are listed under a list in #userList element.
Login Page:
A form (#loginFormContainer) is provided for users to log in.
It includes a username (#username) input and a "Join Chat" button.
Chat Page:
The chat interface displayed after user login.
Messages (#messages) are displayed within a list.
A form (#messageForm) and an input area (#mainInput) are provided for sending new messages.
An admin user can open a new chat window to monitor the keystrokes of a clicked user.
JavaScript Code:
Communicates with the server via WebSocket.
Initiates the chat after setting the username.
Defines functions for sending and receiving messages.
Displays online users as the user list updates.
Allows admin user to monitor keystrokes of a clicked user from the online users list.
Listens for login and message sending actions and sends them to the server via WebSocket.
This file represents the client side of a basic chat application allowing users to chat, see online users, and enables admin user to monitor keystrokes of a specific user.
